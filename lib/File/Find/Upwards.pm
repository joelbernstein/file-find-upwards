=head1 NAME

File::Find::Upwards - Search for a upwards, starting with cwd

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use File::Find::Upwards ':all';

    my $filename = file_find_upwards('myconfig.yaml');
    if ($filename) { ... }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a function that can find a file in the current or a parent directory.

=head1 ExPORTS

Nothing is exported automatically. The function can be exported using its name
or the C<:all> tag.

=item file_find_upwards()

Takes a filename and looks for the file in the current directory. If there is
no such file, it traverses up the directory hierarchy until it finds the file
or until it reaches the topmost directory. If the file is found, the full path
to the file is returned. If the file is not found, undef is returned.

The result is memoized, so repeated calls to the function with the same
filename will return the result of the first call for that filename.
